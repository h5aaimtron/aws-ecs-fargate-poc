Description: >
    This template deploys an Application Load Balancer to the public subnets, which exposes the various 
    ECS services. It is created in a seperate nested template so it can be referenced by all of
    the other nested templates and so that the various ECS services can register with it.

Parameters:

    EnvironmentName:
        Description: An environment name that will be prefixed to resource names
        Type: String

    SecurityGroup:
        Description: Select the Security Group to apply to the Application Load Balancer
        Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup::Id

    Subnets:
        Description: Choose which subnets the Application Load Balancer should be deployed to
        Type: List<AWS::EC2::Subnet::Id>

    VPC:
        Type: AWS::EC2::VPC::Id
        Description: Choose which VPC the Application Load Balancer should be deployed to
